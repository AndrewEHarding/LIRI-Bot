Have you ever wanted the SIRI experience but either can't afford an iPhone, fear the robot overlords, or both?!? Then LIRI is for you! My Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface is capable of completing tasks laid out for it on the command line.
Tasks include:
* `concert-this` - Provides you with concert venue of any band you search for
* `spotify-this-song` - Gets info on any song searched along with a spotify preview link
* `movie-this` - Accesses the OMDb database to get you access to your favorite movie
* `do-what-it-says` - This function is unpredictable and should be used with caution
